    Knowledge doesn't exist in a vaccum. We can think of knowledge as human encoed information.
    Books don't contain knowledge, they contain information;
    it is when we read, and understand a piece of information,
    that knowledge is born. Knowledge is not raw data, it comes from either previous knowledge,
    or directly from experience. A book is a collection of pages that form a story,
    a page is a piece of paper with text on it, text is a collection of characters, etc.
    At some point, the recursion has to stop, and our knowledge will come directly from experience.
    Whatever knowledge we are unable to articulate, comes directly from experience.
    To teach you something, I don't edit the connection between your neurons, I explain how something
    relates to something else, and you make the connections yourself.
