  text: >
    That all our knowledge begins with experience there can be no doubt.
    For how is it possible that the faculty of cognition should be
    awakened into exercise otherwise than by means of objects which affect
    our senses, and partly of themselves produce representations, partly
    rouse our powers of understanding into activity, to compare to
    connect, or to separate these, and so to convert the raw material of
    our sensuous impressions into a knowledge of objects, which is
    called experience? In respect of time, therefore, no knowledge of ours
    is antecedent to experience, but begins with it.
